Before learning how to make software, I used to test it for a living. When I tested a development, I would invariably send it back to the dev team to fix. It was really, really frustrating, because I was normally the first person who had written any test cases, despite being the last person to see the ticket before it got released - that just seems backwards, doesn't it?

Obviously the developers had a rough idea of what the ticket was meant to achieve, but it was rarely documented, and there was never any unit testing.

*"We're here to write code, testing is your job!" - A developer, 2015*

I'm here to tell you that testing is your job. It's your job because you are a good developer, who cares about the quality of your work, and about the maintainability and extensibility of your code base.

Writing a comprehensive, well-structured set of unit tests for your code leads to better design decisions. And it also acts as documentation for your code. These are both good things.

### SOLID Code

My most favouritest bit of making software is the bit before you've written a single line of code, where you get to design your solution. For me, that normally involves some high-level domain modelling, but the real value comes from writing test cases, particularly unit tests.
