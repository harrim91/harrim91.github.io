Web Developer with a background in QA, Mathematics & Philosophy.

I love solving problems, and I love making things. I have a demonstrable desire to learn, to push myself towards best practices, and to write the best, cleanest, most thoroughly tested code I possibly can.

I'm now looking for my first role as a developer in a company which has similar commitments to me. I care about craftsmanship, and I want to work with craftsmen who will challenge me and facilitate my learning.

Skills
---

#### Quick Learner
In 12 weeks I have built a working proficiency in Ruby and JavaScript, and frameworks such as Angular and Rails. Much of this learning has been self-led – I am confident in my abilities and getting stuck doesn’t phase me.

#### Analytic
My undergrad and postgrad studies in Mathematics and Philosophy have shaped the way I think and given me a strong ability to break problems down and to understand and use complex ideas. 

#### Testing
I spent almost 2 years working as a QA Analyst, manually writing and executing feature and regression tests on a monolithic system. This has given me a real commitment to well tested, well written code.

## Product Reviews from Pair Partners

`I've never met anybody like Michael. He is unique. At first you just see like a pinprick, but when you get to know him he opens up and has so much more depth.`

`Michael is very, very, very intelligent and is a problem solver. He is always willing to take the time to explain things and is a good teacher.`

`He has crazy concentration. When working on a problem, he is so focused and driven until he achieves his goal.`

`There is a romantic intensity to everything he does, from coding, to playing guitar, to talking about his girlfriend or wooden spoons.`
