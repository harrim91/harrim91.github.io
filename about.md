Junior Web Developer & [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) Graduate with a background in QA, Mathematics & Philosophy.

I love solving problems, and I love making things. I have a demonstrable desire to learn, to push myself towards best practices, and to write the best, cleanest, most throughly tested code I possibly can.
