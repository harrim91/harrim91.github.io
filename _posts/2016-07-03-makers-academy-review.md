About 4 months ago I started this blog with the honest intention of regularly posting about my time at Makers Academy. Turns out that I overestimated how much time I would be able to commit to that endeavour, and my blog looks embarrasingly identical to how it did on my last post.

The good news is that going to Makers is one of the best decisions I ever made. Maybe even the single best.

All of my expectiations were met, all of my ambitions for the course were met, and all of my apprehensions soon vanished into thin air.

But now, as of this weekend, I'm an unemployed Makers Academy graduate. This means I have an abundance of both time and of enthusiasm for talking about code. Surely a potent combination for any would-be blogger.


So I figured as a starting point, I would come good on my original intention and talk retrospectively about my time at Makers, and three reasons why it's so great.

*N.B. Having written this post, I've realised that I can probably write a whole blog post about each individual thing I talk about.*

## 1. You never stop learning

Makers is hard. You're ALWAYS confronted by something new. On the first day of the week, you start something completely new, that you've probably never seen before.  
Your initial reaction is like :confused: :neutral_face:  
Then you and your pair-partner tackle the problem :raised_hands: :tada: :beers:  
Then you move onto the next problem :anguished: :confounded:  

Over the course of a five-day week, the number of problems you overcome grows, and the number of things you learn grows even more. Each new problem can leave you feeling like you don't know much. But at the end of the week, you look back to Monday morning, and realise that you learned a hell of a lot.

Then you go and spend the weekend making an application by yourself, which really, really compounds that knowledge.

Then you multiply that learning by 12, and by the time you finish, you really know a lot.

Languages, frameworks and testing frameworks I've covered in the last 3 months include:
<ul>
	<li>
		Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL.
	</li>
	<li>
		Sinatra, Rails, AngularJS, Ionic, Cordova.
	</li>
	<li>
		RSpec & Capybara, Jasmine, Karma & Protractor.
	</li>
</ul>

 For our final project, [Happy Belly](https://github.com/harrim91/allergy_scanner_frontend) we made an Ionic/Angular mobile application (which we had never done before) with a barcode scanner (which we had never done before) and we also built a [decoupled rails api](https://github.com/harrim91/allergy_scanner_backend) (we'd used rails before, but we'd never built an API before). But 11 weeks in, we just took it all in our stride. :pineapple:

## 2. You learn more than just how to code

On our first day at Makers, Ben (our coach) asked us "Who came to Makers to learn how to code?" We all raised our hands.

"That was a bit of a lie", he announced.

 The obvious thing you learn is the technical skills. But that's just the subject matter of the course, you could change one language or framework for another and get the same learning outcomes.

 It's a bit like studying philosophy. It's kind of frustrating when people ask you *"What is philosophy? It's like the meaning of life and stuff, right?"* And you try and explain what metaphysics is, and they start to glaze over because it seems to have no practical use in any conceivable situation.

 *But that's not the point of studying philosophy.* Studying philosophy teaches you *how to think*. It teaches you to handle and use complex abstract ideas, it teaches you to deconstruct other people's complex ideas and arguments, and how to form and articulate your own. You might be an expert in metaphysics, but you can have a philosophy of anything; the subject matter isn't what's important -it's the skillset that you can apply to it. In studying philosophy, you build skills that allow you to engage in philosophical discourse on any subject, and those skills transfer into all walks of life.

 At Makers, you develop a similarly generic skillset, beyond learning Ruby and JavaScript. You learn how to be a developer.

 - How to write good code. Not just code that works, but code that is easy to read and understand, easy to extend, easy to change, easy to test.  
 This covers things like Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development.  Before I write any code, I write up a user stories, I write up a domain map, and I write feature tests. When I start getting into that first feature, I write unit tests. And it my unit tests for my provisional idea, and it those unit tests are too complex, I revise my approach to solving the problem. I try to use SOLID principles and I try to avoid code smells, and to not to repeat myself. I don't think I'm bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I know my code can always be written better.

 - How to deal with getting stuck - I feel like I have the skills to get a grip on any technical problem. I know how to explain the problem I'm having. I know how to ask good questions. I have confidence to test hypotheses because I know at worst it will to give me new insights to a problem. I know when I'm getting tunnel vision and just need to take a break. And I have confidence to keep plugging away, because I know I'll get there.

 - How to work as a professional developer - at Makers you work in an agile environment, you practice the latest industry standard practices, and you are taught to taking pride in your work and not to compromise on quality: *Coding isn't just a hobby; it's my profession.*  
 [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org) and [Software Craftsmanship](manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) are two related concepts that you will live and breath at Makers. These aren't solely about the code you write; they offer guidance on how professional software developers should aim to conduct themselves as a member of a development team, and as part of the wider tech community.


## 3. You learn about yourself, you challenge yourself, and you improve yourself

I just feel like I'm a better person for having attended Makers. The [XP values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html) of communication, feedback, respect and courage are definitely things I'm trying to incorporate into my daily life. I've always naturally been a bit of a closed book. If I struggled with something, I would tend to bottle it up and deal with it myself. If I had a problem with something, I wouldn't air it for fear of upsetting people.

Working in pairs or groups every day really improves how you deal with people. You appreciate how other people work, and what they can bring to a collaboration, you learn to trust them, and you learn to give feedback on how they might improve, where you might once have got frustrated.  
And it goes both ways: You learn to take feedback, you learn about your blind-spots and about how other people see you. You generally become more self-aware, more honest, more encouraging and generally a more awesome person.

One thing I struggled most with at first when working in a group was the idea of letting someone else work on a new part of the system and not having some kind of continuous understanding of the how that component worked, and what their plan was, in case things went wrong. But even if things did go wrong, I would still partly be in the wrong there, because my colleague is just as smart as me, has the same principles as me, and I should trust them. If they had gotten the wrong end of the stick as to the requirement, it's a failure of communication. Now, letting go and trusting my team isn't a problem, because I know how to deal with it.

Another real benefit of Makers on a personal level is Dana, the Chief Joy Officer. She really is the heartbeat and the soul of the place. I think her primary job is to distract you from working as much as she possibly can, but she has so much time for everybody, so much sage advice and I really can't explain what an asset she is to Makers.

Everyday she facilitates mindfulness mediation, and twice a week she leads yoga. Both of these are things I'd been interested in prior to Makers, and were an attraction when applying to the course. But I didn't realise **how** great it would be. With so much going on throughout the day, it's theraputic to just take time to sit and focus on the present moment. You just sit and objectively observe and accept your current thoughts, feeling and sensations without attaching any value judgement to it. It can be quite hard, but I think my brain would have regularly exploded without it, and I now find it easier to relax and to turn off.

Yoga has a similarly theraputic effect, and was one of the biggest surprises for me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it half as much as meditation, but I really, really love it. A big part of it for me is the self-dicipline it teaches. It's hard (really hard), and a lot of the time I just want to collapse on the floor. It takes a lot of focus to hold a pose for an extended period of time, but I love the intense feeling that comes with trying to find that focus, and it's good to know that I'm doing something difficult for my own good. Learning to code is difficult, but not as difficult as your third chair pose of the day, and the gratification isn't as instant either. Another thing about yoga is the effect it has on your meditation. After an intense hour of physical exercise, your body just relaxes, you don't notice any physical niggles and you're able focus your mind so much more. If I can master my physical body, then my mind is easy, right? The balance between body and mind is often overlooked, with one favoured over the other, but getting the balance is super important and yoga help you do that.

It's been a really positive feeling to see myself progressing personally on so many levels (particularly physically with the yoga, I have to admit). I'm a better, more open person, and more receptive to criticism. I've made incredible friends, people who I'm possibly going to know for the rest of my life/career. I feel my mind and body are both stronger and more balanced, and I generally just feel happy and confident, and excited to move forward with my life.

## TL;DR
I would recommend the course to anybody. :ok_hand: :100:
