It's a really good feeling to figure out something you really like doing, and to take a positive step to bring that thing more into your life.


Last summer at some point, during a conversation about how much I've always liked wooden spoons and how great it would be to make them, I realised that there's no reason I shouldn't, and living in London probably mean it was entirely possible. So I went and took a lesson with [Barn the Spoon](http://www.barnthespoon.com/) at [The Greenwood Guild](http://www.thegreenwoodguild.com), and now I go to Spoon Club every Thursday and my flat is full of spoons, butter spreaders and wood shavings.

About 18 months ago I sort of fell into a job in the technology industry as a software tester, and over the last year, I've found I've been increasingly interested in how the code works.

So again, I thought "Why not?!" and now I've just completed the first week of the pre-course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), a super-intensive coding bootcamp which will be taking over my life for the next 16 weeks, with the end goal of being ready to get a job as a junior developer.

This is exciting for lots of reasons:

- I am going to be learning new things every day.
- I am going to be making things and solving problems every day.
- I am going to be meeting lots of people who also like learning and making and solving.
- I am going to get a job that pays a decent amount and work in London instead of stupid Croydon.

Awesome, huh?



I was offered also actually offered the chance to learn development at my current job, but turned it down because I figured that if I could complete the course at Makers, it was going to give me better learning opportunities, better career prospects, and do it a lot faster. So I decided against it, and now I'm out of there and onto the next step.

So what have I done this week?

The week started on Monday (obvs.) and we had the pre-course launch, which was basically a presentation about what to expect from Makers and what they would expect from us, and then we all went to the pub. Good start.

On Tuesday we got an email with the learning material and challenges, and now I dream about the word grep and writing good commit messages. This week the focus was on getting to grips with git and the command line. I have worked a little with both in the past, but I feel like I learned A LOT this week. The challenges we got from Makers were challenging (as challenges tend to be) and massively useful, but without being too intense and impossible. But obviously it's week 1, of the pre-course and it's vaguely familiar territory for me. I expect that this time next week I will be a trembling mess as we move onto the serious business of Ruby.

Also, I decided to start this blog. I was intending on doing one and was going to repurpose an old wordpress account that I never really used, but then I found out about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), so I decided to challenge myself and do a more self-sufficient blog. So here we are.

At this point, the blog looks like this:

Hopefully you're reading this a few weeks down the line and it's a bit more impressive. But right now I'm still trying to figure it out and I just wanted to post something.

SO yeah, next week we're moving onto Ruby, I'm expecting it to be a lot harder, but again I am just really excited to take on the challenge. Also, this coming week is my last at my current job, then I'M FREEEEE to focus on the course full-time. It's just a great feeling knowing I'm going onto something better.
