About 4 months ago I started this blog with the honest intention of regularly posting about my time at Makers Academy. Turns out that I overestimated how much time I would be able to commit to that endeavour, and my blog looks embarrasingly identical to how it did on my last post.  

But now, as of this weekend, I'm an unemployed Makers Academy graduate. This means I have an abundance of both time and of enthusiasm for talking about code. Surely a potent combination for any would-be blogger.


So I figured as a starting point, I would come good on my original intention and talk retrospectively about my time at Makers.
